# Module Grade Calculator

A program to calculate the module grades based on the mark achieved in each assessment and the weightings of the assessments.

This is my first app written using Flutter, proceed with caution...

## Usage
Make sure that flutter is installed and up-to-date by running:
`flutter upgrade --force`

Then run the app with:
`flutter run`

## TODO
- Clean up code 
- Better document code
- Add assessment type indicator which adds a suitable icon to the left of ListTile (see https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ListTile-class.html)
- Add input validation to int text boxes
- Add validation to stop over 100% of total module being added

### Long-term ideas
- Add a way to 'load' assessments (eg have a JSON file saved with assessment templates saved that can be loaded and filled out)
